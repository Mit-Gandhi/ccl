Drug Reaction,"An adverse drug reaction (ADR) is an injury caused by taking medication. ADRs may occur following a single dose, prolonged administration of a drug, or as a result of combining two or more drugs. These reactions can be mild, moderate, severe, or life-threatening. ADRs often mimic underlying diseases, making diagnosis challenging. Symptoms may include rash, urticaria (hives), itching, erythema (redness), angioedema (swelling under the skin), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloating, constipation, wheezing, shortness of breath, bronchospasm, coughing, anaphylaxis, dizziness, headaches, confusion, hallucinations, seizures, hepatotoxicity (liver damage), nephrotoxicity (kidney damage), arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat), hypotension (low blood pressure), hypertension (high blood pressure), myalgia (muscle pain), and arthralgia (joint pain). Certain medications, such as antibiotics, NSAIDs, anticonvulsants, and chemotherapy drugs, have a higher risk of causing ADRs. In severe cases, ADRs may lead to organ failure, anaphylactic shock, or death.",stop irritation,consult nearest hospital,stop taking drug,follow up
Malaria,"Malaria is an infectious disease caused by Plasmodium parasites and transmitted through the bite of infected Anopheles mosquitoes. The most severe form, Plasmodium falciparum malaria, can lead to organ failure and death if untreated. Symptoms usually appear 10–15 days after infection and include high fever, chills, excessive sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting, muscle pain, fatigue, dizziness, abdominal pain, diarrhea, rapid breathing, cough, confusion, seizures, and jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes). Severe cases can cause cerebral malaria, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), metabolic acidosis (excess acid in the blood), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), kidney failure, and anemia. Malaria is more common in tropical and subtropical regions. Early detection and treatment with antimalarial drugs such as chloroquine, artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), and quinine are crucial for survival. Preventive measures include mosquito nets, insect repellents, and prophylactic medications.",Consult nearest hospital,avoid oily food,avoid non veg food,keep mosquitos out
Allergy,"An allergy is an exaggerated immune system response to a harmless foreign substance (allergen) such as pollen, dust mites, pet dander, mold, insect venom, certain foods (nuts, dairy, shellfish, eggs), or medications (penicillin, NSAIDs, sulfa drugs). When exposed to an allergen, the immune system releases histamines and other chemicals, triggering an allergic reaction. Symptoms vary depending on the allergen and may include sneezing, runny nose, nasal congestion, itchy or watery eyes, coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, hives, swelling (angioedema), skin rash, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, dizziness, and anaphylaxis (a life-threatening reaction causing difficulty breathing and a drop in blood pressure). Common allergy types include seasonal allergies (hay fever), food allergies, drug allergies, insect sting allergies, and contact dermatitis. Allergy management includes avoiding allergens, taking antihistamines, decongestants, corticosteroids, and epinephrine (for severe reactions). Immunotherapy (allergy shots) can help reduce sensitivity to allergens over time.",apply calamine,cover area with bandage,,use ice to compress itching
Hypothyroidism,"Hypothyroidism, also called underactive thyroid or low thyroid, is a disorder in which the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormones, leading to a slowed metabolism and various symptoms. People with hypothyroidism may experience fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, dry skin, hair thinning, brittle nails, constipation, depression, slow heart rate, muscle weakness, joint pain, puffiness in the face, hoarseness, memory issues, difficulty concentrating, swelling in the neck due to an enlarged thyroid (goiter), menstrual irregularities, and feeling sluggish or mentally foggy. Severe cases can lead to myxedema, which can cause extreme fatigue, swelling, low body temperature, and even coma if left untreated. The condition is commonly caused by Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, iodine deficiency, or certain medications.",reduce stress,exercise,eat healthy,get proper sleep
Psoriasis,"Psoriasis is a chronic skin disorder that causes the rapid buildup of skin cells, leading to red, inflamed patches covered with silvery-white scales. These patches can appear anywhere on the body but are most common on the scalp, elbows, knees, and lower back. Symptoms include dry, cracked skin that may bleed, itching, burning, soreness, thickened or ridged nails, and joint pain in some cases. Psoriasis can flare up due to stress, infections, cold weather, or injury to the skin. Some people also experience psoriatic arthritis, which causes joint pain and stiffness. The condition is not contagious but tends to run in families. Treatment focuses on managing symptoms with moisturizers, medicated creams, light therapy, and immune-modulating drugs.",wash hands with warm soapy water,stop bleeding using pressure,consult doctor,salt baths
GERD,"Gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD, occurs when stomach acid frequently flows back into the esophagus, irritating its lining. This happens when the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) weakens or relaxes inappropriately. Symptoms include heartburn, a burning sensation in the chest, acid regurgitation, sour or bitter taste in the mouth, difficulty swallowing, chest pain, chronic cough, sore throat, hoarseness, bad breath, bloating, nausea, and the feeling of a lump in the throat. Symptoms often worsen after eating, when lying down, or at night. Long-term GERD can lead to complications like esophageal ulcers, strictures, and Barrett’s esophagus, which increases the risk of esophageal cancer. Common triggers include spicy foods, fatty meals, caffeine, alcohol, smoking, and obesity. Treatment involves lifestyle changes, dietary adjustments, medications like antacids, proton pump inhibitors, and H2 blockers, and in severe cases, surgery.",avoid fatty spicy food,avoid lying down after eating,maintain healthy weight,exercise
Chronic cholestasis,"Chronic cholestasis refers to a long-term impairment in the flow of bile from the liver to the intestine, leading to a buildup of bile acids in the liver. This condition can occur at any age and is typically associated with primary damage to the bile ducts or biliary epithelium. The accumulation of bile acids in the liver can lead to liver damage, inflammation, and progressive scarring. Symptoms of chronic cholestasis include persistent jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), dark urine, pale or clay-colored stools, intense itching (pruritus), fatigue, loss of appetite, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, bloating, and abdominal pain, especially in the upper right quadrant. The condition may also lead to deficiencies in fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K), causing issues like night blindness, bone pain, muscle weakness, and easy bruising or bleeding. In advanced cases, it can lead to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and liver failure. Causes of chronic cholestasis include primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), genetic disorders like Alagille syndrome, autoimmune diseases, viral infections, drug-induced liver injury, and bile duct obstructions caused by gallstones or tumors. Treatment focuses on relieving symptoms, improving bile flow, and managing complications with medications such as ursodeoxycholic acid, bile acid sequestrants, antihistamines for itching, vitamin supplementation, and in severe cases, liver transplantation.",cold baths,anti itch medicine,consult doctor,eat healthy
hepatitis A,"Hepatitis A is a highly contagious viral infection that causes inflammation of the liver, affecting its ability to process toxins and produce essential proteins. The hepatitis A virus (HAV) spreads primarily through the ingestion of contaminated food or water, or through close contact with an infected person. It is most commonly transmitted through poor sanitation and hygiene practices. Symptoms typically appear within two to six weeks of exposure and may include fever, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, abdominal pain (especially in the upper right side), diarrhea, joint pain, dark-colored urine, pale or clay-colored stools, and jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes). The infection can also cause intense itching, muscle aches, and general malaise. While hepatitis A does not cause chronic liver disease like hepatitis B or C, it can lead to severe complications such as acute liver failure in rare cases, especially in older adults or those with pre-existing liver conditions. Most people recover fully within a few weeks to months, but the illness can cause prolonged symptoms in some cases. Prevention includes good hygiene, proper food handling, and vaccination, which is highly effective in preventing the disease. There is no specific antiviral treatment for hepatitis A, and management focuses on rest, hydration, and supportive care to relieve symptoms.",Consult nearest hospital,wash hands through,avoid fatty spicy food,medication
Osteoarthristis,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease that occurs when the protective cartilage that cushions the ends of bones gradually breaks down, leading to pain, stiffness, swelling, and reduced joint mobility. It is the most common form of arthritis and primarily affects weight-bearing joints such as the knees, hips, spine, and hands. The condition develops slowly over time due to aging, repetitive joint stress, previous joint injuries, genetic predisposition, obesity, and joint misalignment. Symptoms of osteoarthritis include persistent joint pain that worsens with movement, morning stiffness lasting less than 30 minutes, joint swelling, tenderness, a grating sensation or cracking sound (crepitus) when moving the affected joint, reduced range of motion, and the formation of bone spurs (osteophytes), which can contribute to further discomfort. In advanced cases, joint deformity and significant loss of function may occur, impacting daily activities such as walking, climbing stairs, gripping objects, or bending. Osteoarthritis is commonly associated with inflammation of the joint lining (synovitis), which can further exacerbate pain and stiffness. Treatment focuses on pain relief, maintaining joint function, and slowing disease progression. Common management strategies include weight loss, physical therapy, low-impact exercises, pain medications like NSAIDs and acetaminophen, corticosteroid injections, hyaluronic acid injections, joint bracing, and assistive devices. In severe cases, surgical options such as joint replacement (arthroplasty) may be considered to restore mobility and relieve pain.",acetaminophen,consult nearest hospital,follow up,salt baths
(vertigo) Paroymsal  Positional Vertigo,"Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is one of the most common causes of vertigo, which is the sudden sensation of spinning or dizziness. BPPV occurs when tiny calcium carbonate crystals (otoconia) in the inner ear become dislodged and move into the semicircular canals, disrupting the balance signals sent to the brain. Symptoms include sudden episodes of dizziness, loss of balance, nausea, vomiting, lightheadedness, unsteadiness, blurry vision, and a sensation that the surroundings are moving or spinning (vertigo). These symptoms are often triggered by specific head movements, such as turning over in bed, looking up, bending down, or sudden head position changes. Episodes usually last for a few seconds to a few minutes but may recur frequently. BPPV is more common in older adults and can be triggered by head trauma, inner ear infections, prolonged bed rest, or aging-related degeneration of the inner ear structures. Although BPPV is not life-threatening, it can significantly impact daily activities and increase the risk of falls. Diagnosis is typically made through the Dix-Hallpike maneuver, and treatment often involves canalith repositioning procedures such as the Epley maneuver to move the displaced crystals back to their proper position. In some cases, medications like antihistamines or vestibular suppressants may be prescribed to relieve symptoms.",lie down,avoid sudden change in body,avoid abrupt head movment,relax
Hypoglycemia,"Hypoglycemia is a condition characterized by abnormally low blood sugar (glucose) levels, which can lead to various neurological and physiological symptoms. Glucose is the body’s main energy source, and when levels drop too low, it can cause symptoms such as shakiness, sweating, confusion, dizziness, hunger, irritability, rapid heartbeat, anxiety, weakness, blurred vision, headaches, and difficulty concentrating. In severe cases, hypoglycemia can lead to seizures, loss of consciousness, or coma. It is most commonly associated with diabetes, particularly in individuals taking insulin or certain oral diabetes medications that lower blood sugar. However, hypoglycemia can also occur in non-diabetic individuals due to prolonged fasting, excessive alcohol consumption, hormonal imbalances, critical illnesses, or insulin overproduction by the pancreas (such as in insulinomas). Reactive hypoglycemia can occur after meals due to excessive insulin release. Symptoms typically improve after consuming fast-acting carbohydrates like fruit juice, glucose tablets, or candy. Preventing hypoglycemia involves monitoring blood sugar levels, adjusting medication dosages, eating balanced meals with sufficient carbohydrates, and avoiding excessive alcohol intake. Severe cases may require medical intervention, including glucagon injections or intravenous glucose administration.",lie down on side,check in pulse,drink sugary drinks,consult doctor
Acne,"Acne vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that affects the sebaceous (oil) glands and hair follicles, leading to the formation of comedones (blackheads and whiteheads), papules, pustules, nodules, and cysts. It commonly appears on the face, chest, shoulders, and back. Acne is most prevalent during adolescence due to hormonal changes that increase sebum (oil) production, but it can also affect adults. Symptoms include pimples, redness, inflammation, skin tenderness, oily skin, and, in severe cases, deep painful nodules and cysts that may leave scars. Factors that contribute to acne include excess oil production, clogged pores, bacterial overgrowth (Propionibacterium acnes), hormonal imbalances, genetic predisposition, stress, certain medications (steroids, lithium), and dietary triggers such as high glycemic foods and dairy. Acne may worsen due to improper skin care, excessive face touching, or the use of comedogenic cosmetics. Treatment options range from topical creams (benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, retinoids), antibiotics, oral contraceptives, isotretinoin (for severe cases), and lifestyle modifications such as maintaining proper skin hygiene and avoiding triggers. While acne is not dangerous, it can lead to emotional distress, reduced self-esteem, and permanent scarring if not managed properly.",bath twice,avoid fatty spicy food,drink plenty of water,avoid too many products
Diabetes,"Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by high blood glucose (blood sugar) levels due to the body's inability to produce or properly use insulin, a hormone responsible for regulating blood sugar. There are three main types of diabetes: type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune condition in which the immune system destroys insulin-producing cells in the pancreas; type 2 diabetes, which results from insulin resistance and is often linked to obesity and lifestyle factors; and gestational diabetes, which occurs during pregnancy and usually resolves after childbirth. Symptoms of diabetes include frequent urination, excessive thirst, extreme hunger, unexplained weight loss, fatigue, blurred vision, slow wound healing, tingling or numbness in hands and feet, recurrent infections, and dry skin. If left untreated, diabetes can lead to severe complications such as nerve damage (neuropathy), kidney disease (nephropathy), vision problems (retinopathy), cardiovascular disease, and an increased risk of infections. Risk factors for diabetes include genetic predisposition, obesity, a sedentary lifestyle, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and poor dietary habits. Management of diabetes includes blood sugar monitoring, insulin therapy or oral medications (such as metformin, sulfonylureas, or SGLT2 inhibitors), regular physical activity, a balanced diet, and weight management. In severe cases, complications like diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) can develop, requiring emergency medical attention.",have balanced diet,exercise,consult doctor,follow up
Impetigo,"Impetigo is a highly contagious bacterial skin infection that primarily affects young children but can also occur in adults. It is caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes bacteria, which enter the skin through cuts, insect bites, or abrasions. The infection usually presents as red sores that quickly rupture and ooze fluid before forming a thick, honey-colored crust. These sores typically appear around the nose, mouth, hands, and feet but can spread to other areas of the body through direct contact or shared items like towels, clothing, or toys. Symptoms of impetigo include itchy or painful lesions, redness, swelling, fluid-filled blisters, and, in severe cases, fever and swollen lymph nodes. There are two primary forms of impetigo: non-bullous impetigo, which causes small, red sores that break open and crust over, and bullous impetigo, which leads to larger fluid-filled blisters that may take longer to heal. If left untreated, impetigo can cause complications such as cellulitis (a deeper skin infection), post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (a rare kidney condition), or scarring. Treatment involves topical or oral antibiotics such as mupirocin, cephalexin, or amoxicillin-clavulanate, along with good hygiene practices to prevent spreading the infection. Keeping the affected area clean and covered can help speed up recovery and reduce transmission.",soak affected area in warm water,use antibiotics,remove scabs with wet compressed cloth,consult doctor
Hypertension,"Hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, is a chronic condition in which the force of blood against the artery walls is consistently too high. It is often called the ""silent killer"" because it typically does not cause noticeable symptoms until significant damage has occurred. Blood pressure is measured in two values: systolic pressure (the force when the heart beats) and diastolic pressure (the force when the heart rests between beats). A normal blood pressure reading is around 120/80 mmHg, while hypertension is generally diagnosed when readings consistently exceed 130/80 mmHg. Over time, uncontrolled hypertension can lead to serious complications such as heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, vision loss, aneurysms, and cognitive decline. Common risk factors for hypertension include obesity, excessive salt intake, high cholesterol, lack of physical activity, smoking, alcohol consumption, stress, genetics, and underlying conditions such as diabetes or kidney disease. Symptoms, when they do appear, may include headaches, dizziness, nosebleeds, chest pain, shortness of breath, and visual disturbances. Management of hypertension includes lifestyle changes such as reducing sodium intake, increasing physical activity, maintaining a healthy weight, managing stress, and avoiding tobacco and excessive alcohol. Medications such as diuretics, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are often prescribed to help regulate blood pressure. Regular monitoring and early intervention are crucial to preventing long-term complications.",meditation,salt baths,reduce stress,get proper sleep
Peptic ulcer diseae,"Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is a condition in which open sores or ulcers form in the lining of the stomach, the first part of the small intestine (duodenum), or, in rare cases, the lower esophagus. These ulcers develop when the protective mucus lining of the digestive tract is damaged, allowing stomach acid to erode the underlying tissue. The two most common causes of peptic ulcers are infection with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) bacteria and long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin and ibuprofen. Symptoms of peptic ulcer disease include burning stomach pain (often occurring between meals or at night), bloating, nausea, vomiting, heartburn, loss of appetite, unintentional weight loss, and dark or tarry stools (indicating bleeding). In severe cases, complications such as internal bleeding, perforation (a hole in the stomach or intestine), and gastric obstruction can occur, leading to serious health risks. Risk factors include excessive alcohol consumption, smoking, stress, and consuming spicy or acidic foods, which can aggravate symptoms but do not directly cause ulcers. Diagnosis is usually confirmed through endoscopy, breath tests for H. pylori, or imaging studies. Treatment includes proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or H2-receptor blockers to reduce stomach acid, antibiotics to eradicate H. pylori, and lifestyle modifications such as avoiding NSAIDs, reducing alcohol intake, and maintaining a healthy diet. In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to address complications.",avoid fatty spicy food,consume probiotic food,eliminate milk,limit alcohol
Dimorphic hemorrhoids(piles),"Hemorrhoids, commonly referred to as piles, are swollen and inflamed veins in the lower rectum and anus that can cause discomfort, bleeding, and itching. Hemorrhoids are classified into two main types: internal hemorrhoids, which develop inside the rectum and are usually painless but can cause rectal bleeding, and external hemorrhoids, which form under the skin around the anus and may cause significant pain, swelling, and irritation. In some cases, hemorrhoids can become thrombosed, meaning that a blood clot has formed inside the swollen vein, leading to severe pain and inflammation. Symptoms of hemorrhoids include rectal pain, itching, swelling, bleeding during bowel movements, mucus discharge, and a feeling of incomplete evacuation. Common causes of hemorrhoids include chronic constipation, straining during bowel movements, prolonged sitting, obesity, pregnancy, a low-fiber diet, and lack of physical activity. Diagnosis is typically made through physical examination, digital rectal examination, or anoscopy. Treatment includes lifestyle changes such as increasing fiber intake, drinking plenty of water, avoiding prolonged sitting, and using stool softeners to reduce straining. Over-the-counter creams containing hydrocortisone, warm sitz baths, and ice packs can help relieve symptoms. In more severe cases, medical procedures such as rubber band ligation, sclerotherapy, infrared coagulation, or surgical removal (hemorrhoidectomy) may be necessary to manage persistent or complicated hemorrhoids.",avoid fatty spicy food,consume witch hazel,warm bath with epsom salt,consume alovera juice
Common Cold,"The common cold is a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract that primarily affects the nose, throat, and sinuses. It is caused by various viruses, with the rhinovirus being the most common culprit. The infection spreads through airborne droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes, as well as through direct contact with contaminated surfaces. Symptoms of the common cold include nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, coughing, mild fever, headache, body aches, watery eyes, fatigue, and postnasal drip. The severity of symptoms can vary, but most people recover within 7 to 10 days. The cold is often confused with the flu, but influenza typically causes more severe symptoms, including high fever, chills, and muscle pain. Risk factors for catching a cold include weakened immunity, close contact with infected individuals, seasonal changes, stress, and lack of sleep. There is no specific cure for the common cold, and treatment focuses on symptom relief through rest, hydration, over-the-counter decongestants, antihistamines, pain relievers, and throat lozenges. Preventive measures include frequent handwashing, avoiding touching the face, staying away from sick individuals, and maintaining a healthy immune system through proper nutrition and regular exercise. While generally harmless, complications such as sinus infections, ear infections, or bronchitis can arise, particularly in individuals with weakened immune systems, asthma, or chronic respiratory conditions.",drink vitamin c rich drinks,take vapour,avoid cold food,keep fever in check
Chicken pox,"Chickenpox is a highly contagious viral infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), primarily affecting children but also occurring in adults who have not been vaccinated or previously infected. The disease spreads through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes, as well as through direct contact with the fluid from chickenpox blisters. The incubation period is typically 10 to 21 days after exposure, followed by the onset of symptoms. The hallmark symptom of chickenpox is an itchy, blister-like rash that first appears on the chest, back, and face before spreading to the entire body, including the scalp, mouth, and genitals. The rash progresses through stages, starting as red spots (macules), then turning into raised bumps (papules), followed by fluid-filled blisters (vesicles) that eventually burst and scab over. Other symptoms include fever, fatigue, headache, sore throat, and loss of appetite. Chickenpox is usually mild but can lead to complications such as bacterial skin infections, pneumonia, encephalitis (brain inflammation), and, in rare cases, severe disease in immunocompromised individuals, pregnant women, or newborns. The varicella vaccine provides effective protection against the virus, reducing the risk of severe infection. Treatment focuses on symptom relief, including antihistamines for itching, acetaminophen for fever, and antiviral medications such as acyclovir for high-risk individuals. Patients should avoid scratching blisters to prevent scarring and secondary infections. Once a person recovers, the virus remains dormant in nerve tissues and can reactivate later in life as shingles (herpes zoster), a painful rash that follows nerve pathways.",use neem in bathing ,consume neem leaves,take vaccine,avoid public places
Cervical spondylosis,"Cervical spondylosis, also known as cervical osteoarthritis or degenerative disc disease, is a condition caused by age-related wear and tear of the spinal discs and joints in the neck (cervical spine). Over time, the spinal discs dehydrate, shrink, and lose their cushioning ability, leading to the formation of bone spurs (osteophytes) and the narrowing of the spinal canal (spinal stenosis). This degeneration can compress nearby nerves and cause symptoms such as neck pain, stiffness, headaches radiating from the neck, tingling or numbness in the arms and hands, muscle weakness, dizziness, and in severe cases, difficulty walking or loss of bladder control. Risk factors include aging, genetics, poor posture, repetitive neck movements, smoking, a sedentary lifestyle, and previous neck injuries. Diagnosis is typically made through physical examination, imaging tests such as X-rays, MRI, or CT scans, and nerve conduction studies if nerve involvement is suspected. Treatment focuses on managing pain and improving mobility through physical therapy, neck exercises, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), muscle relaxants, and corticosteroid injections. In severe cases, surgery such as spinal fusion or decompression may be required to relieve nerve compression and restore function. Preventive measures include maintaining good posture, engaging in regular neck-strengthening exercises, avoiding prolonged screen time, and using ergonomic work setups.",use heating pad or cold pack,exercise,take otc pain reliver,consult doctor
Hyperthyroidism,"Hyperthyroidism, or an overactive thyroid, is a condition in which the thyroid gland produces excessive amounts of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), leading to an accelerated metabolism and a wide range of symptoms. The most common cause of hyperthyroidism is Graves' disease, an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system mistakenly attacks the thyroid gland, causing it to become overactive. Other causes include thyroid nodules, thyroiditis (inflammation of the thyroid), excessive iodine intake, and taking too much thyroid hormone medication. Symptoms of hyperthyroidism include unexplained weight loss, rapid or irregular heartbeat (palpitations), increased appetite, sweating, heat intolerance, nervousness, anxiety, tremors, insomnia, muscle weakness, frequent bowel movements, and thinning hair. In some cases, patients may develop an enlarged thyroid gland (goiter) or bulging eyes (exophthalmos) due to Graves' disease. If left untreated, hyperthyroidism can lead to complications such as osteoporosis, heart disease, atrial fibrillation, and thyrotoxic crisis (thyroid storm), a life-threatening condition characterized by extremely high thyroid hormone levels. Diagnosis is made through blood tests measuring thyroid hormone levels (TSH, T3, T4), radioactive iodine uptake scans, and thyroid ultrasound. Treatment options include antithyroid medications such as methimazole or propylthiouracil to reduce hormone production, beta-blockers to manage symptoms, radioactive iodine therapy to shrink the thyroid gland, and, in severe cases, thyroid surgery (thyroidectomy). Patients with hyperthyroidism should monitor their condition regularly and make lifestyle modifications such as managing stress, maintaining a balanced diet, and avoiding excessive iodine intake.",eat healthy,massage,use lemon balm,take radioactive iodine treatment
Urinary tract infection,"A urinary tract infection (UTI) is a bacterial infection that affects any part of the urinary system, including the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. Most UTIs are caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli), a bacteria commonly found in the gastrointestinal tract, which can enter the urinary tract through the urethra and multiply in the bladder. UTIs are more common in women due to their shorter urethra, which allows bacteria to reach the bladder more easily. Symptoms of a UTI include a strong, persistent urge to urinate, burning sensation during urination, cloudy or strong-smelling urine, pelvic pain, lower abdominal discomfort, blood in the urine (hematuria), and, in more severe cases, fever and chills. If the infection spreads to the kidneys (pyelonephritis), symptoms may include back pain, nausea, vomiting, and high fever. Risk factors for UTIs include poor hygiene, sexual activity, urinary retention, dehydration, menopause, pregnancy, diabetes, and the use of catheters. Diagnosis is confirmed through urinalysis, urine culture, and, in recurrent cases, imaging tests such as ultrasound or CT scans. Treatment typically involves antibiotics such as nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or ciprofloxacin, along with increased fluid intake to help flush out bacteria. Preventive measures include maintaining good personal hygiene, wiping from front to back after using the toilet, urinating after intercourse, drinking plenty of water, and avoiding excessive use of irritating feminine hygiene products. Recurrent UTIs may require further medical evaluation to rule out underlying conditions such as kidney stones or structural abnormalities in the urinary tract.",drink plenty of water,increase vitamin c intake,drink cranberry juice,take probiotics
Varicose veins,"Varicose veins are enlarged, twisted, and swollen veins that appear as bulging, blue or purple blood vessels visible through the skin, most commonly occurring on the legs and feet. These veins develop when the valves in the veins become weak or damaged, allowing blood to pool and causing the veins to stretch and twist. Common symptoms of varicose veins include aching pain, heaviness, burning, swelling, throbbing, muscle cramps, and itching around the affected veins. Symptoms may worsen after standing or sitting for long periods. In severe cases, varicose veins can lead to complications such as skin ulcers, blood clots (deep vein thrombosis), or bleeding from ruptured veins. Risk factors include aging, prolonged standing or sitting, obesity, pregnancy, a family history of varicose veins, and hormonal changes. Diagnosis is typically based on a physical examination and may be confirmed through ultrasound to assess blood flow. Treatment options include lifestyle modifications such as regular exercise, wearing compression stockings, elevating the legs, and avoiding prolonged standing. Medical treatments include sclerotherapy (injection therapy), laser therapy, radiofrequency ablation, or surgical procedures such as vein stripping and ligation for severe cases. Preventive measures include maintaining a healthy weight, avoiding high heels, staying physically active, and not crossing legs while sitting for extended periods.",lie down flat and raise the leg high,use oinments,use vein compression,dont stand still for long
AIDS,"Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is a life-threatening condition caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which attacks and weakens the immune system by destroying CD4+ T cells. As a result, the body becomes more vulnerable to infections, diseases, and certain cancers. HIV is primarily transmitted through unprotected sexual contact, sharing contaminated needles, transfusion of infected blood, or from mother to child during childbirth or breastfeeding. The early stages of HIV infection may present flu-like symptoms, including fever, sore throat, swollen lymph nodes, muscle aches, fatigue, and rash. As the disease progresses, symptoms may include persistent fever, night sweats, chronic diarrhea, rapid weight loss, oral thrush, and frequent infections. AIDS is diagnosed when the immune system is severely compromised, and the individual develops opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis, pneumonia, or Kaposi’s sarcoma. Diagnosis of HIV is confirmed through blood tests such as the ELISA test, Western blot, or rapid HIV test. There is no cure for HIV/AIDS, but antiretroviral therapy (ART) can help suppress the virus, improve immune function, and prevent progression to AIDS. Preventive measures include practicing safe sex, avoiding shared needles, regular HIV testing, and taking pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) medication for high-risk individuals.",avoid open cuts,wear ppe if possible,consult doctor,follow up
Paralysis (brain hemorrhage),"Paralysis due to a brain hemorrhage, also known as intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), occurs when a blood vessel in the brain bursts, causing blood to leak into brain tissue and damaging brain cells. This condition can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Common causes of brain hemorrhage include high blood pressure (hypertension), head trauma, aneurysms, blood clotting disorders, brain tumors, and the use of anticoagulant medications. Symptoms of brain hemorrhage often appear suddenly and may include severe headache, weakness or numbness (especially on one side of the body), difficulty speaking or understanding speech, vision problems, dizziness, loss of coordination, confusion, nausea, vomiting, and loss of consciousness. In severe cases, the hemorrhage can lead to complete paralysis, coma, or death. Diagnosis is made through imaging tests such as CT scans, MRI, or cerebral angiography. Treatment focuses on stabilizing the patient, controlling bleeding, reducing brain swelling, and preventing further complications. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the blood clot or repair damaged blood vessels. Rehabilitation, including physical therapy, speech therapy, and occupational therapy, is essential for recovery and improving mobility and function. Preventive measures include managing high blood pressure, avoiding excessive alcohol consumption, quitting smoking, and monitoring anticoagulant medication use.",massage,eat healthy,exercise,consult doctor
Typhoid,"Typhoid fever is a bacterial infection caused by Salmonella Typhi, transmitted through contaminated food or water. It is common in areas with poor sanitation and can lead to serious complications if left untreated. The bacteria enter the digestive tract and spread through the bloodstream, affecting multiple organs. Symptoms of typhoid fever develop gradually, beginning with prolonged high fever, headache, fatigue, abdominal pain, constipation or diarrhea, loss of appetite, chills, muscle aches, weakness, and a distinctive rose-colored rash on the chest and abdomen. As the infection progresses, it can lead to complications such as intestinal perforation, internal bleeding, meningitis, and septicemia. Diagnosis is confirmed through blood, stool, or urine cultures, along with the Widal test. Treatment involves antibiotics such as azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, or ceftriaxone to eliminate the bacteria. Supportive care includes hydration, bed rest, and a soft, easily digestible diet. Preventive measures include maintaining proper hygiene, drinking clean water, avoiding raw or unwashed foods, and receiving the typhoid vaccine before traveling to high-risk areas. In severe cases, hospitalization may be required to manage complications.",eat high calorie vegitables,antiboitic therapy,consult doctor,medication
Hepatitis B,"Hepatitis B is a serious liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). It can be acute or chronic, with long-term complications such as liver scarring (cirrhosis), liver failure, and liver cancer. Hepatitis B spreads through contact with infected blood, semen, vaginal fluids, or other bodily fluids. It can be transmitted through unprotected sexual contact, sharing needles, mother-to-child transmission during childbirth, or needlestick injuries in healthcare settings. Symptoms may not appear immediately, but when they do, they include fatigue, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), dark urine, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, joint pain, and fever. Chronic hepatitis B can remain silent for years before leading to severe liver damage. Diagnosis is made through blood tests that detect HBV antigens, antibodies, and liver function abnormalities. There is no specific cure for hepatitis B, but antiviral medications can help slow the progression of the disease. In severe cases, a liver transplant may be required. The best prevention method is vaccination, which provides long-term immunity. Other preventive measures include practicing safe sex, avoiding shared needles, screening blood donations, and using protective barriers when dealing with infected individuals.",consult nearest hospital,vaccination,eat healthy,medication
Fungal infection,"Fungal infections occur when fungi overgrow in or on the body, leading to irritation, inflammation, and discomfort. Fungi are present in the environment, including soil, water, air, and even inside the human body. Some fungal infections are superficial, affecting the skin, nails, or hair, while others are systemic, impacting internal organs. Common fungal infections include athlete’s foot (tinea pedis), ringworm (tinea corporis), yeast infections (candidiasis), fungal nail infections (onychomycosis), and lung infections such as histoplasmosis. Symptoms vary depending on the type and location of the infection but can include redness, itching, burning, flaking, peeling skin, discolored or thickened nails, and white patches in the mouth or throat. Invasive fungal infections, such as cryptococcosis or aspergillosis, can cause fever, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, and organ failure. Risk factors include a weakened immune system, diabetes, excessive antibiotic use, poor hygiene, warm and humid environments, and prolonged use of damp clothing or shoes. Diagnosis is made through skin scrapings, cultures, or blood tests. Treatment depends on the infection and includes antifungal creams, oral medications, or intravenous antifungal therapy for severe cases. Preventive measures include maintaining proper hygiene, keeping skin dry, avoiding walking barefoot in public areas, wearing breathable clothing, and strengthening the immune system through a healthy diet and lifestyle",bath twice,use detol or neem in bathing water,keep infected area dry,use clean cloths
Hepatitis C,"Hepatitis C is a viral infection that causes liver inflammation and, in some cases, serious liver damage. It is caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) and is primarily spread through blood-to-blood contact, including sharing contaminated needles, receiving infected blood transfusions (before screening became widespread), and needle-stick injuries in healthcare settings. Less common transmission routes include sexual contact and mother-to-child transmission. Hepatitis C often does not show symptoms in its early stages, leading to chronic infection that can silently damage the liver over decades. When symptoms do appear, they include fatigue, jaundice, dark urine, clay-colored stools, abdominal pain, nausea, loss of appetite, and joint pain. Chronic hepatitis C can lead to complications such as cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer). Diagnosis is made through blood tests that detect HCV antibodies and viral RNA. Unlike hepatitis B, there is no vaccine for hepatitis C, but antiviral medications, including direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), can effectively cure most cases. Preventive measures include avoiding shared needles, using barrier protection during sex, practicing safe medical procedures, and screening blood donations. Regular monitoring of liver function and avoiding alcohol consumption are essential for managing the disease.",Consult nearest hospital,vaccination,eat healthy,medication
Migraine,"A migraine is a neurological condition characterized by recurrent episodes of severe headache, often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light and sound. Migraines are typically unilateral (affecting one side of the head), with a throbbing or pulsating pain that can last from a few hours to several days. Migraines can be triggered by various factors, including stress, hormonal changes, sleep disturbances, dehydration, certain foods (such as caffeine, alcohol, and processed foods), weather changes, and sensory stimuli like bright lights or strong smells. There are different types of migraines, including migraines with aura (visual or sensory disturbances before the headache), migraines without aura, chronic migraines (occurring more than 15 days per month), and vestibular migraines (causing dizziness and balance issues). Symptoms of migraines can include intense headache pain, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, visual disturbances (flashing lights, blind spots), tingling sensations, and difficulty concentrating. Diagnosis is typically based on medical history and symptom patterns, as there is no definitive test for migraines. Treatment includes pain relief medications such as NSAIDs, triptans, and anti-nausea drugs. Preventive treatments, including beta-blockers, antidepressants, and anti-seizure medications, may be prescribed for chronic migraines. Lifestyle changes such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, staying hydrated, managing stress, avoiding known triggers, and practicing relaxation techniques can help reduce the frequency and severity of migraine attacks.",meditation,reduce stress,use poloroid glasses in sun,consult doctor
Bronchial Asthma,"Bronchial asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways that results in episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughing, particularly at night or early in the morning. The condition is caused by hypersensitivity of the bronchial tubes to various triggers, leading to airway constriction and excess mucus production. Common triggers include allergens such as dust mites, pollen, pet dander, mold, cold air, respiratory infections, smoke, pollution, strong odors, stress, and certain medications like aspirin or NSAIDs. Asthma symptoms vary from mild to severe and can be intermittent or persistent. During an asthma attack, the airway muscles tighten, inflammation increases, and mucus clogs the air passages, making breathing difficult. In severe cases, an asthma attack can be life-threatening if not treated promptly. Diagnosis is made through lung function tests, such as spirometry and peak flow measurement, and sometimes allergy tests to identify triggers. Treatment includes inhalers (bronchodilators such as albuterol for quick relief and corticosteroids for long-term control), leukotriene modifiers, and lifestyle modifications to avoid triggers. Inhaled corticosteroids are the most effective long-term control medication, while rescue inhalers provide immediate relief during an attack. Preventive measures include maintaining a clean environment, avoiding known triggers, managing stress, and following a prescribed asthma management plan. Severe cases may require hospitalization and oxygen therapy.",switch to loose cloothing,take deep breaths,get away from trigger,seek help
Alcoholic hepatitis,"Alcoholic hepatitis is a serious and potentially fatal condition caused by excessive alcohol consumption over time, leading to inflammation and damage to the liver. The condition is more common in people who engage in heavy drinking or binge drinking. The liver, which processes and filters toxins, becomes overwhelmed by alcohol, resulting in swelling, fat accumulation, and liver cell death. Symptoms of alcoholic hepatitis include jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain (especially in the upper right side), fever, weakness, weight loss, and confusion (due to toxins building up in the blood). In severe cases, complications such as liver failure, ascites (fluid buildup in the abdomen), bleeding disorders, and encephalopathy (brain dysfunction caused by liver disease) can occur. Diagnosis is made through liver function tests, imaging studies, and liver biopsy in some cases. The primary treatment for alcoholic hepatitis is complete cessation of alcohol consumption, as continued drinking can lead to cirrhosis and liver failure. Supportive care includes nutritional therapy, vitamin supplementation (especially thiamine and folic acid), corticosteroids or pentoxifylline to reduce inflammation, and in severe cases, liver transplantation. Prevention involves limiting alcohol intake, maintaining a healthy diet, staying hydrated, and seeking medical help for alcohol dependency. Early intervention is crucial to prevent progression to irreversible liver disease.",stop alcohol consumption,consult doctor,medication,follow up
Jaundice,"Jaundice is a condition characterized by yellowing of the skin, eyes, and mucous membranes due to high levels of bilirubin in the blood. Bilirubin is a yellow pigment produced when red blood cells break down. Normally, the liver processes bilirubin and excretes it in bile, but when liver function is impaired or bile flow is obstructed, bilirubin accumulates in the body, leading to jaundice. Causes of jaundice include liver diseases such as hepatitis, cirrhosis, alcoholic liver disease, and liver cancer, as well as conditions like hemolytic anemia (excessive breakdown of red blood cells), bile duct obstruction (due to gallstones or tumors), and genetic disorders such as Gilbert’s syndrome. Symptoms of jaundice include yellowing of the skin and eyes, dark urine, pale stools, fatigue, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, itching, and weight loss. Diagnosis involves blood tests to measure bilirubin levels, liver function tests, ultrasound, CT scans, and liver biopsy in some cases. Treatment depends on the underlying cause: viral hepatitis may require antiviral medications, bile duct obstruction may need surgical intervention, and liver failure may necessitate a transplant. In newborns, jaundice is common due to immature liver function and usually resolves on its own or with phototherapy. Prevention includes maintaining liver health by avoiding excessive alcohol, getting vaccinated for hepatitis, managing cholesterol levels, and staying hydrated.",drink plenty of water,consume milk thistle,eat fruits and high fiberous food,medication
Hepatitis E,"Hepatitis E is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis E virus (HEV), which is primarily transmitted through contaminated water, undercooked pork, or shellfish. It is more common in regions with poor sanitation and contaminated drinking water. Unlike hepatitis B and C, hepatitis E does not usually cause chronic liver disease, but it can be severe in pregnant women, leading to fulminant hepatitis or liver failure. Symptoms of hepatitis E include jaundice, dark urine, pale stools, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, loss of appetite, and joint pain. In most cases, the infection resolves on its own within a few weeks, but in immunocompromised individuals, such as those with organ transplants or HIV, chronic hepatitis E can occur. Diagnosis is made through blood tests that detect HEV antibodies or RNA. There is no specific antiviral treatment for hepatitis E; supportive care such as rest, hydration, and avoiding alcohol is recommended. Preventive measures include drinking clean water, avoiding raw or undercooked meat, practicing good hygiene, and improving sanitation. In some countries, a hepatitis E vaccine is available, but it is not widely used globally.",stop alcohol consumption,rest,consult doctor,medication
Dengue,"Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne viral infection caused by the Dengue virus, which belongs to the Flavivirus genus. It is transmitted primarily by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. Dengue is prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions and is commonly found in urban and semi-urban areas. The infection can range from mild flu-like symptoms to severe complications such as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue shock syndrome (DSS), which can be life-threatening. Symptoms of dengue fever include high fever, severe headaches, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pain (hence the nickname ""breakbone fever""), skin rash, nausea, vomiting, swollen glands, and fatigue. In severe cases, symptoms can escalate to internal bleeding, difficulty breathing, persistent vomiting, severe abdominal pain, and organ failure. Dengue is diagnosed through blood tests that detect the presence of the virus or antibodies. There is no specific antiviral treatment for dengue; management includes supportive care such as hydration, pain relief with acetaminophen (not aspirin or NSAIDs, as they can worsen bleeding risks), and close monitoring for complications. Prevention focuses on mosquito control, including eliminating breeding grounds, using insect repellents, wearing protective clothing, and implementing large-scale mosquito control programs. A dengue vaccine is available in some regions but is recommended only for those who have had previous dengue infections. Early detection and proper medical care can significantly reduce fatality rates associated with severe dengue.",drink papaya leaf juice,avoid fatty spicy food,keep mosquitos away,keep hydrated
Hepatitis D,"Hepatitis D, also known as hepatitis delta, is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis D virus (HDV). It is unique because it only occurs in individuals who are already infected with hepatitis B, as HDV requires the hepatitis B surface antigen to replicate. This co-infection can lead to a more severe form of liver disease, increasing the risk of cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer. Hepatitis D is transmitted through blood and other bodily fluids, commonly through sharing needles, unprotected sexual contact, or from mother to child during childbirth. Symptoms of hepatitis D are similar to other hepatitis infections and may include jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, and pale stools. Chronic hepatitis D can cause progressive liver damage, leading to complications such as portal hypertension, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy. Diagnosis is confirmed through blood tests that detect HDV antibodies or viral RNA. There is no specific cure for hepatitis D, but treatment options include antiviral therapy such as pegylated interferon-alpha, which may help control the virus in some patients. Preventing hepatitis D relies on preventing hepatitis B infection through vaccination, avoiding sharing needles, practicing safe sex, and taking precautions in healthcare settings. For individuals already infected with hepatitis B, regular monitoring of liver function and early intervention can help manage complications.",consult doctor,medication,eat healthy,follow up
Heart attack,"A heart attack, also known as a myocardial infarction (MI), occurs when blood flow to a part of the heart muscle is blocked, usually due to a buildup of fatty deposits (plaques) in the coronary arteries. This blockage deprives the heart muscle of oxygen, causing tissue damage or death. Heart attacks are a medical emergency and require immediate treatment to restore blood flow and prevent further complications. Symptoms of a heart attack can vary but commonly include chest pain or discomfort (often described as pressure, squeezing, or fullness), pain radiating to the arms, jaw, neck, back, or stomach, shortness of breath, nausea, dizziness, cold sweats, and fatigue. Some individuals, particularly women, diabetics, and older adults, may experience atypical or mild symptoms. Diagnosis is confirmed through electrocardiogram (ECG), blood tests measuring cardiac enzymes (such as troponin), and imaging tests such as coronary angiography. Immediate treatment includes medications such as aspirin, nitroglycerin, thrombolytics (clot busters), and emergency procedures like angioplasty with stent placement or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Long-term management involves lifestyle changes, including a heart-healthy diet, regular exercise, smoking cessation, stress management, and medications such as beta-blockers, statins, and anticoagulants to prevent further cardiac events. Recognizing the warning signs of a heart attack and seeking medical help promptly can significantly improve survival and recovery outcomes.",call ambulance,chew or swallow asprin,keep calm,
Pneumonia,"Pneumonia is a serious infection that causes inflammation in one or both lungs due to bacterial, viral, or fungal infections. The infection leads to fluid or pus accumulation in the alveoli, the tiny air sacs in the lungs responsible for oxygen exchange. Pneumonia can range from mild to life-threatening, with elderly individuals, young children, and those with weakened immune systems at higher risk. Symptoms include persistent cough (often producing phlegm), fever, chills, difficulty breathing, chest pain when breathing or coughing, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. Bacterial pneumonia is commonly caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, while viral pneumonia is often due to influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), or SARS-CoV-2. Fungal pneumonia is less common but can affect individuals with weakened immunity. Pneumonia is diagnosed through physical examination, chest X-rays, blood tests, and sputum analysis. Treatment depends on the cause; bacterial pneumonia is treated with antibiotics, viral pneumonia may require antiviral medications, and fungal pneumonia is treated with antifungal drugs. Supportive care includes rest, hydration, oxygen therapy in severe cases, and over-the-counter medications for symptom relief. Prevention involves vaccination (such as pneumococcal and flu vaccines), good hygiene practices, and avoiding smoking or pollutants that can harm lung health. Early detection and treatment improve recovery and prevent complications such as respiratory failure or sepsis",consult doctor,medication,rest,follow up
Arthritis,"Arthritis refers to inflammation of the joints, leading to pain, stiffness, swelling, and reduced mobility. It is a broad term encompassing over 100 different types, with osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) being the most common. Osteoarthritis occurs due to the gradual wear and tear of cartilage, leading to bone friction and joint damage, typically affecting the knees, hips, hands, and spine. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder where the immune system mistakenly attacks joint tissues, causing inflammation, pain, and potential joint deformity. Other types include psoriatic arthritis, gout (caused by uric acid buildup in joints), and ankylosing spondylitis. Symptoms of arthritis include joint pain, swelling, stiffness (especially in the morning or after inactivity), redness, warmth around the affected joints, and difficulty performing daily tasks. Arthritis is diagnosed through physical examinations, imaging tests (X-rays, MRI, CT scans), and blood tests to detect inflammation markers. Treatment focuses on pain management and slowing disease progression, including medications such as NSAIDs, corticosteroids, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) for RA, and lifestyle modifications like weight management, physical therapy, regular exercise, and joint-friendly activities like swimming and yoga. Severe cases may require joint injections or surgical interventions like joint replacement. Preventive measures include maintaining a healthy weight, staying active, avoiding joint injuries, and managing underlying conditions contributing to arthritis.",exercise,use hot and cold therapy,try acupuncture,massage
Gastroenteritis,"Gastroenteritis, often called the ""stomach flu,"" is an inflammation of the digestive tract, primarily affecting the stomach and intestines. It is commonly caused by viral infections such as norovirus or rotavirus, but bacterial and parasitic infections can also be responsible. The condition spreads through contaminated food, water, or close contact with an infected person. Symptoms of gastroenteritis include watery diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps, bloating, fever, muscle aches, dehydration, and fatigue. In severe cases, it can lead to complications like electrolyte imbalance and severe dehydration, particularly in young children, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals. Diagnosis is based on symptoms and, in some cases, stool tests to identify the infectious agent. Treatment primarily involves supportive care, including hydration with oral rehydration solutions (ORS), electrolyte replacement, rest, and dietary modifications such as consuming bland foods and avoiding dairy or spicy foods. Antibiotics are prescribed only if bacterial infections like Salmonella or E. coli are confirmed. Prevention involves good hygiene practices, proper food handling, vaccination against rotavirus, and avoiding contaminated water sources. In most cases, gastroenteritis resolves within a few days, but early medical attention is crucial for severe symptoms.",stop eating solid food for while,try taking small sips of water,rest,ease back into eating
Tuberculosis,"Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, primarily affecting the lungs but potentially impacting other organs, such as the brain, kidneys, and bones. TB spreads through airborne droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes, making it highly contagious. The disease can exist in two forms: latent TB, where the bacteria remain dormant without causing symptoms, and active TB, which presents with persistent symptoms. Common symptoms of active TB include a chronic cough lasting more than three weeks, coughing up blood (hemoptysis), chest pain, fever, night sweats, unexplained weight loss, fatigue, and loss of appetite. Diagnosis involves tuberculin skin tests (Mantoux test), blood tests, chest X-rays, and sputum cultures to detect the bacteria. TB is treatable with a long-term antibiotic regimen, usually involving a combination of drugs such as isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide for at least six months. Drug-resistant TB strains require specialized treatment with second-line antibiotics. Preventive measures include the BCG vaccine (Bacillus Calmette-Guérin), early detection, and treatment of latent TB to prevent its progression. Proper ventilation, wearing masks in high-risk settings, and completing prescribed medication courses are crucial in controlling TB spread. Without treatment, tuberculosis can cause severe complications, including lung damage and multi-organ failure, making early diagnosis and adherence to treatment essential.",cover mouth,consult doctor,medication,rest
